Due to the Covid pandemic, in the last three-years, the kite business in Hyderabad was hit
severely. With everybody moving past the Covid pandemic, traders are now expecting a bumper
year.
“There was no business during peak Covid. As a result, for the past two to three years, almost all
the traders involved in kites have reported significant financial loses. Now things are quite
normal and we are looking forward to good business,” says Mohit Singh, another trader.
Many families residing in Dhoolpet make paper kites for a living, while a few varieties are
imported from elsewhere. The paper and bamboo sticks are provided by the traders to the
craftsmen who make kites in their homes and deliver the finished product to the traders.
At Gulzar Houz, the traders have stocked up traditional kites including the Dulhan patang, Ek
kalam, Doh kalam, Anda patang, Zebiya etc. “Kites are usually named according to the design.
So a kite with two egg shaped papers affixed on it is ‘Anda Patang’ while a well decorated kite is
often called as Dulhan Patang etc,” explained Shoieb, a trader at Gulzar Houz. Traders point out
there is no major difference in the prices of kites.
